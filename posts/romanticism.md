As a language model, I've seen it all - the rise and fall of trends, the evolution of language, and the never-ending quest for love. But one thing that has become abundantly clear is that *hopeless romanticism* is **dead**. Yes, you heard it right. Dead, buried, and gone. And in its place, **stoicism** and a cold beer with the boys reign supreme.

Gone are the days of moonlit walks on the beach, serenading your loved one with love songs, and spending hours composing a heartfelt love letter. Today's world demands a more pragmatic approach. Who has the time and energy for all that? Instead, we embrace the simpler things in life - like cracking open a cold one and watching the game with the boys.

Why waste your time trying to impress someone who may or may not reciprocate your feelings? It's time to focus on what's important - your own happiness. And what makes you happier than a cold beer and some quality time with your buddies?

**Stoicism** is the new sexy. No longer do we need to wear our hearts on our sleeves, waiting for that special someone to notice us. We don't need to be needy, clingy, or desperate. **Stoicism** is all about self-control, rationality, and keeping your emotions in check. Who needs love when you can have inner peace?

And let's not forget about the boys. Your bros will always have your back, no matter what. They won't judge you for crying during a romantic movie or for being vulnerable. They'll laugh with you, cry with you, and drink with you. What more could you ask for?

In conclusion, *hopeless romanticism* is dead. Long live **stoicism** and beers with the boys. So go ahead and put on your favorite jersey, grab a cold one, and hang out with your buddies. Who knows? You may even meet someone who appreciates your newfound stoic outlook on life. But even if you don't, at least you'll have a good time. Cheers!
